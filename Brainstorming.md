## CV Application views
* Technology View: Shows all technologies. Can be checked/unchecked. Then shows infos grouped by tech:
    * First time used
    * Last time used
    * Gross total time used (last time - first time)
    * Net total time used (sum of use among projects)
    * Projects it was used in
    * Jobs it was used in
    * Time Filter from/to with slider
* Timeline View:
    * Everything in a nice timeline from start to end similar to Stack Overflow
    * Possible to check/uncheck what to see (Techs, Projects, Jobs, Titles/Promotions, Companies)
    * Filter by tech (checkboxes) => only projects where tech was used appear
    * Filter by tasks (checkboxes) => only projects where task was done appear


## Further ideas
* List linkedIn endorsements next to technologies/skills
* Add compare feature (user can enter details about another candidate)
* Add links to documents (e.g. Arbeitszeugnis), maybe with additional security
* Only display company names to certain people
* Make it a PWA
* Visually integrate into blog
* Make blog a PWA
* Enable formatting texts (e.g. using markdown)
* Make it an APP
* Add an editor for data
* Do different versions (Angular, React, Vanilla, native APP)
* Enable users to extract data to be imported in common hiring applications
* Unit tests for the data:
  * Is a technology used as tool elsewhere?
  * Do all items end in a period?

## Why?
I'm a software developer, so a CV that is software itself and therefore part of my development work makes sense. Showcases my work.
I'm not going to write a CV as my job at the potential employer but will develop applications.

## Goals
* Showcase skills:
    * UI Design
    * User experience
    * Programming style => Put it on github
    * React
    * Data Visualization
    * CSS (use grid)
* Make it more fun to write and maintain CV
* Avoid textual fluff as much as possible (just present facts)
* Give employers easy way to find out about me
